React/Redux Todo List Web App

This web app is intended for users to build a "todo" list, enabling users to display a list of their to-do items. Users may mark their tasks with one of three statuses, which will filter between three status boxes. Lastly, users may delete to-do item(s) at their discretion.

Technologies used HTML, CSS, Javascript, Tailwind CSS, ReactJS, React Router, Redux, React Redux, UUID, Font Awesome

Ideas for future improvment:
1.) The Tailwind CSS library was used to style and add responsiveness for Web App; however, no custom CSS styles were used as illustrated from index.css. Utilizing custom made CSS styles may aid in styling the web app in a manner that the Tailwind CSS library may not.
2.) The tasks that were added will stay, even when changing between pages, such as from the Todos page to the Contact page and back; however, if the web site is refreshed, then the information, or states reset. As such, it would improve the app to retain the information even after refreshing the page.
