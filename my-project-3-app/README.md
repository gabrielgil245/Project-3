React/Redux Todo List Web App

This web app is intended for users to build a "todo" list, enabling users to display a list of their to-do items. Users may mark their tasks with one of three statuses, which will filter between three status boxes. Lastly, users may delete to-do item(s) at their discretion.

Technologies used HTML, CSS, Javascript, Tailwind CSS, ReactJS, React Router, Redux, React Redux, UUID, Font Awesome

Ideas for future improvment:
1.) The Tailwind CSS library was used to style and add responsiveness for Web App; however, no custom CSS styles were used as illustrated from index.css. Utilizing custom made CSS styles may aid in styling the web app in a manner that the Tailwind CSS library may not.
2.) Initially, this web app was created with React-Redux; however, it was reworked to primarily use React with Hooks given the scope of the project. Still, the transition back to React-Redux may help to expand the features for this web app, such as sending notifications to the user, when a task item should be started and its deadline.
3.) The tasks are now locally stored in the users device; however, an improvement to this would be in enabling users to create an account, so that the state of these tasks are stored externally for the user's account.
